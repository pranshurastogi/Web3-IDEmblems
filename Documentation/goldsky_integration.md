## Improvement and feedback

1. Install CLI command should be here at this page in docs, this will improve UX as it is hard to find the install command while reading about pipeline CLI 
https://docs.goldsky.com/mirror/create-a-pipeline#creating-mirror-pipelines-with-the-cli

2. AI search does not work, it is slow and sucks a lot. Alternatively, normal search bar should be there.

3. Issue with resource allocation, I am using trial plan but at the very end it says you cannot use medium. Ideally to improve UX it should not allow other one. I was not able to upgrade also.

4. There is an issue with Sink secret name in CLI, it throws an error in CLI while using it.
