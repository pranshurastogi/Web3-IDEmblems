## Features

- **Wallet Registration**: Users can register their Ethereum wallets by paying a small fee, which grants them an initial verification level.
- **Verification Levels**: Wallets can be upgraded through various verification processes, such as Worldcoin sign-in and Gitcoin Passport, to increase their credibility.
- **EAS Integration**: The platform uses the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to create and store verifiable proofs of actions and identities.
- **Analytics and Emblems**: Wallet activities are analyzed to assign badges or emblems, which reflect the wallet's reputation in areas like DeFi participation, NFT holdings, or potential spam activity.
- **Multi-Network Deployment**: The platform is deployed on Optimism, Base, and Metal L2, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.

## Components

- **Smart Contract**: Manages wallet registration, verification levels, and the storage of EAS attestations.
- **Node.js Backend**: Facilitates interactions between the blockchain, external services, and the smart contract.
- **Verification Services**: External services like Worldcoin and Gitcoin Passport that validate the identity of wallet owners.
- **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)**: Provides verifiable proofs of wallet actions and identities.
- **Alchemy API**: Fetches blockchain data to facilitate on-chain analytics.
- **Goldsky**: Analyzes wallet activities to assign dynamic badges based on behavior.
- **Postgres Database**: Stores and retrieves relevant data for the platform.
- **L2 Networks**: Deployed on Optimism, Base, and Metal L2 for scalability and cost efficiency.
